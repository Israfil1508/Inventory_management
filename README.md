# Inventory_management
Inventory management is the process of tracking, controlling, and optimizing a company’s stock of goods—from raw materials to finished products—throughout the supply chain. Its main goal is to ensure the right products are available at the right time, in the right quantity, while minimizing costs and avoiding overstocking or stockouts.
